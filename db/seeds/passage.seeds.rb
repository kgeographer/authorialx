By 1776 he had acquired partial ownership of the <span class=\"placeref\" val=\"30051\">Drury Lane</span> theater, which he would control until 1811. But in addition to the theater, Sheridan actively pursued a career in politics, eventually being elected as a member of parliament. His biographer Fintan O'Toole provides a vivid description of his daily life at this time: \"When he had to work intensively, he would get up at four in the morning, surround his desk with dozens of lit candles, and order a continual supply of toasted muffins. But most days he woke about noon, often feeling fuzzy from the previous night's drinking. He had his breakfast in bed and stayed there until about two in the afternoon, making notes for the speeches he intended to make that night, or attending to whatever theatre business he could not avoid\" (pp. 195-6)."}
